# theMoviesApp
 
#Backdrop images are not showing on the movieDb API, so the image for scrolling on second screen is the same as the Poster Path.

An iOS app in Swift showing a list of the Top Rated Movies with their main info.
Using iCarousel for image scrooling on FilmDetailView

Pods used: 
- AlamofireObjectMapper;
- Kingfisher.

Issues:
- Layout not completly responsive yet, use iPhone 11 for better viewing; 
- Backdrop image issue on the movieDB API.


Thanks!
