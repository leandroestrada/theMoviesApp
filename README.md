# theMoviesApp
An iOS app in Swift showing a list of the Top Rated Movies with their main info

Pods used: 
- AlamofireObjectMapper;
- Kingfisher.

Working on:
- Layout not completly responsive yet, use iPhone 11 for better viewing;
- Length on FilmDetailViewView;
- Pod FSPagerView for slide between pictures on FilmDetailView.

Thanks!
